# Webhooks

Webhooks allow OwlStack to notify your application when events happen on the server - such as scheduled posts being published, batch operations completing, or retries succeeding.

## Setup

1. Go to the [OwlStack dashboard](https://app.owlstack.dev)
2. Navigate to **Project Settings > Webhooks**
3. Click **Add Webhook Endpoint**
4. Enter your endpoint URL (e.g., `https://example.com/webhooks/owlstack`)
5. Select which events to receive
6. Copy the signing secret

## Events

| Event | Description | Plan |
|:------|:------------|:-----|
| `post.published` | A post was successfully published | All |
| `post.failed` | A post failed to publish | All |
| `batch.completed` | A batch publish operation completed | Pro |
| `schedule.fired` | A scheduled post was published | Pro |
| `schedule.failed` | A scheduled post failed | Pro |

## Payload format

```json
{
  "event": "post.published",
  "timestamp": "2026-02-14T10:30:00Z",
  "data": {
    "post_id": "ps_abc123",
    "platform": "twitter",
    "external_id": "1234567890",
    "external_url": "https://twitter.com/user/status/1234567890"
  }
}
```

## Verifying webhooks

Every webhook request includes an `X-OwlStack-Signature` header. Verify it using the signing secret:

```php
$payload = file_get_contents('php://input');
$signature = $_SERVER['HTTP_X_OWLSTACK_SIGNATURE'];
$secret = env('OWLSTACK_WEBHOOK_SECRET');

$expected = hash_hmac('sha256', $payload, $secret);

if (! hash_equals($expected, $signature)) {
    http_response_code(401);
    exit('Invalid signature');
}
```

## Laravel example

```php
Route::post('/webhooks/owlstack', function (Request $request) {
    $event = $request->input('event');
    $data = $request->input('data');

    match ($event) {
        'post.published' => Log::info("Published to {$data['platform']}"),
        'post.failed' => Log::error("Failed on {$data['platform']}"),
        'batch.completed' => Log::info("Batch completed"),
        default => null,
    };

    return response('OK', 200);
});
```

## Retry policy

If your endpoint returns a non-2xx status code, OwlStack retries the webhook up to 3 times with exponential backoff (1 minute, 5 minutes, 30 minutes).
