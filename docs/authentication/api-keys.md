# API Keys

API keys authenticate your application with OwlStack's cloud service. Every API call requires a valid key.

## Creating an API key

1. Log in to the [OwlStack dashboard](https://app.owlstack.dev)
2. Go to **Project Settings > API Keys**
3. Click **Create API Key**
4. Name the key (e.g., "Production", "Staging")
5. Copy the key -- it's only shown once

## Using your API key

### Standalone PHP

```php
use OwlStack\Cloud\OwlStackClient;

$client = new OwlStackClient(
    apiKey: getenv('OWLSTACK_API_KEY'),
);
```

### Laravel

Add to your `.env` file:

```ini
OWLSTACK_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

The service provider reads this automatically from `config/owlstack.php`.

### WordPress

Enter the API key in **WP Admin > OwlStack > Settings**.

## Key permissions

API keys inherit the permissions of the plan they belong to:

| Plan | Permissions |
|:-----|:------------|
| Free / Starter | Publish, read results |
| Pro | Publish, batch, schedule, read logs, analytics |
| Pro + AI | Everything in Pro + AI endpoints |
| Enterprise | Full access including admin endpoints |

## Revoking a key

Go to **Project Settings > API Keys** and click **Revoke** next to the key. Revoked keys stop working immediately.

## Security best practices

- Never commit API keys to source control
- Use environment variables or secret managers
- Rotate keys periodically
- Use separate keys for production and development
- Revoke unused keys
