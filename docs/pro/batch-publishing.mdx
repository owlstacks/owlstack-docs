# Batch Publishing

import ProBadge from '@site/src/components/ProBadge';

<ProBadge />

Publish to multiple platforms in a single call with built-in error handling and retry strategies.

```php
use Owlstack\Pro\Publishing\BatchPublisher;

$batchPublisher = new BatchPublisher($publisher);

$results = $batchPublisher->publish($post, ['telegram', 'twitter', 'discord']);

// Results is an array: ['telegram' => PublishResult, 'twitter' => PublishResult, ...]
foreach ($results as $platform => $result) {
    echo $result->success
        ? "✓ {$platform}\n"
        : "✗ {$platform}: {$result->error}\n";
}
```

## Laravel

In Laravel, batch publishing can be dispatched as a queue job:

```php
use Owlstack\Pro\Laravel\Jobs\BatchPublishJob;

BatchPublishJob::dispatch($post, ['telegram', 'twitter', 'discord']);
```
