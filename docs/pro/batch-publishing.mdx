# Batch Publishing

import ProBadge from '@site/src/components/ProBadge';

<ProBadge />

Publish to multiple platforms in a single optimized API call. Available on **Pro** plans and above.

## Basic usage

```php
use OwlStack\Cloud\OwlStackClient;
use OwlStack\Post;
use OwlStack\Enums\Platform;

$client = new OwlStackClient('your-api-key');

$post = Post::create('Big announcement!')
    ->withUrl('https://example.com/announcement')
    ->withHashtags(['news', 'update']);

// Single call publishes to all platforms
$results = $client->publish($post, [
    Platform::Twitter,
    Platform::LinkedIn,
    Platform::Telegram,
    Platform::Discord,
    Platform::Facebook,
]);

foreach ($results as $result) {
    echo $result->isSuccessful()
        ? "Published to {$result->platform()->value}\n"
        : "Failed on {$result->platform()->value}: {$result->error()}\n";
}
```

## Batch multiple posts

Publish different content to different platforms in one API call:

```php
$results = $client->publishBatch([
    ['post' => $announcementPost, 'platforms' => [Platform::Twitter, Platform::LinkedIn]],
    ['post' => $casualPost, 'platforms' => [Platform::Discord, Platform::Telegram]],
    ['post' => $visualPost, 'platforms' => [Platform::Instagram, Platform::Pinterest]],
]);
```

## Laravel

In Laravel, dispatch batch publishing as a queue job:

```php
use OwlStack\Laravel\Facades\OwlStack;

// Async via Laravel queues
OwlStack::publishAsync($post, [
    Platform::Twitter,
    Platform::LinkedIn,
    Platform::Telegram,
]);
```

## How it works

Batch publishing is processed server-side on OwlStack Cloud:

1. Your SDK sends a single API request with all posts and platforms
2. OwlStack Cloud formats content per-platform (character limits, hashtags, media)
3. Posts are delivered concurrently to all platforms
4. Results are returned in one response

This is faster and more reliable than making individual API calls.
