# Queue System

import ProBadge from '@site/src/components/ProBadge';

<ProBadge />

OwlStack Pro provides queue contracts for background job processing. Framework packages implement these with native queue systems.

## Laravel implementation

Publishing jobs are dispatched to Laravel's queue system:

- `BatchPublishJob` — Processes batch publishes
- `AutomationJob` — Processes automation rules
- `AiGenerateJob` — Processes AI content generation

Configure your queue driver in `config/queue.php` as usual — Redis, SQS, database, etc.
