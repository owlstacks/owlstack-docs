# Connect Platforms

OwlStack manages all platform connections through the dashboard at [app.owlstack.dev](https://app.owlstack.dev). You authenticate via OAuth, and OwlStack stores and refreshes tokens automatically.

## How to connect a platform

1. Log in to the [OwlStack dashboard](https://app.owlstack.dev)
2. Go to **Project Settings > Platforms**
3. Click **Connect** next to the platform you want
4. Authorize OwlStack in the platform's OAuth flow
5. The platform appears as "Connected" in your dashboard

Once connected, you can start publishing to that platform from your code immediately.

## Supported platforms

| Platform | OAuth Type | What you need |
|:---------|:-----------|:--------------|
| Telegram | Bot Token | BotFather token + channel admin access |
| Twitter/X | OAuth 2.0 PKCE | Twitter Developer account |
| Facebook | OAuth 2.0 | Facebook App + Page admin access |
| LinkedIn | OAuth 2.0 | LinkedIn Developer app |
| Discord | Webhook URL | Server admin to create webhook |
| Instagram | OAuth 2.0 | Facebook Business account |
| Pinterest | OAuth 2.0 | Pinterest Business account |
| Reddit | OAuth 2.0 | Reddit app (script type) |
| Slack | OAuth 2.0 | Slack workspace admin |
| Tumblr | OAuth 2.0 | Tumblr app |
| WhatsApp | Business API | WhatsApp Business account |

## Platform limits by plan

| Plan | Platforms |
|:-----|:----------|
| Free tier | 1 |
| Starter | 3 |
| Pro | All 11 |
| Pro + AI | All 11 |
| Enterprise | All 11 |

## Disconnecting a platform

Go to **Project Settings > Platforms** and click **Disconnect** next to the platform. This removes the stored tokens. You can reconnect at any time.

## Using your own credentials (pass-per-request)

If you prefer to manage credentials yourself, you can pass them with each publish request instead of using managed OAuth. See [Platform Credentials](../authentication/platform-credentials.md) for details.
