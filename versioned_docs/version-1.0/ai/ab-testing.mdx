# A/B Testing

import ProBadge from '@site/src/components/ProBadge';

<ProBadge plan="Pro+AI" />

Create content variants and let AI determine which performs best. Available on the **Pro+AI** plan.

## Create an A/B test

```php
use OwlStack\Cloud\OwlStackClient;
use OwlStack\Enums\Platform;

$client = new OwlStackClient('your-api-key');

$test = $client->ai()->abTest(
    variants: [
        'Exciting news: OwlStack 2.0 is here!',
        'We just shipped OwlStack 2.0 -- check it out',
        'OwlStack 2.0: AI-powered social media publishing',
    ],
    platforms: [Platform::Twitter],
    duration_hours: 24,
);

echo "Test ID: {$test->id}\n";
echo "Status: {$test->status}\n";
```

## How it works

1. **Create variants** -- Provide 2-5 different versions of your post
2. **AI publishes** -- Each variant is sent to a portion of your audience
3. **Track engagement** -- OwlStack monitors likes, clicks, shares per variant
4. **Winner selected** -- After the test period, AI picks the best performer
5. **Scale up** -- Optionally auto-publish the winner to remaining platforms

## Check results

```php
$results = $client->ai()->abTestResults($test->id);

echo "Winner: Variant {$results->winnerIndex}\n";
echo "Winning text: {$results->winner->body}\n\n";

foreach ($results->variants as $i => $variant) {
    echo "Variant {$i}: {$variant->engagement->likes} likes, ";
    echo "{$variant->engagement->clicks} clicks, ";
    echo "{$variant->engagement->shares} shares\n";
}
```

## Auto-publish winner

Let OwlStack automatically publish the winning variant to additional platforms:

```php
$test = $client->ai()->abTest(
    variants: ['Version A', 'Version B', 'Version C'],
    platforms: [Platform::Twitter],
    duration_hours: 12,
    options: [
        'auto_publish_winner' => true,
        'winner_platforms' => [Platform::LinkedIn, Platform::Facebook],
    ],
);
```

## AI-generated variants

Let AI create the variants for you:

```php
$test = $client->ai()->abTestWithGeneration(
    prompt: 'Announce our new AI features',
    platforms: [Platform::Twitter],
    variant_count: 3,
    duration_hours: 24,
);
```
